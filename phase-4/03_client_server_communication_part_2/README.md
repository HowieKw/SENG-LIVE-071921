# Phase 4 - Lecture 3 Client/Server Communication part2

## Today's Topics

- Adding Update/Delete functionality to our API to complete full CRUD
- How to write add column migrations
- Practicing how to break down feature requirements into the RESTful API endpoints they require

## Features for Meetup Clone

- Users can delete an event they created
- Users can leave a group
- Users who rsvp'd to an event can delete their RSVP
- Users can update an event they created
- Users can update whether a user attended an event

## Features for Reading List Application

- Users can update whether or not they have read a book
- Users can remove a book from their reading list

Again, we'll be breaking down the functionality into pieces, starting with the request, going through route, controller, model and leading to a response. Today, I'll be asking for more input from you all about what the RESTful requests should be to support these features.

## Users can delete an event they created

### Request
What request method do we need?
- GET, POST, PATCH, or DELETE
What will the path be?
- ... 
Do we need the Content-Type header?
- ...
Do we need a body? If so, what will it include?
- ...
### Route
What route do we need?
- ...
### Controller
Which controller action(s) do we need?
- ...
### Model/Database
Any changes needed to model layer?
- ...
What model objects are involved and how do we interact with them in the controller?
- ...
### Response
What should the response be to our API request?
- ...
